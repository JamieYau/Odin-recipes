    <h1>Charlie's Milk Steak</h1>
    <img src="../images/milk-steak.jpg" alt="milk steak" />
    <h2>A scrumptious steak dinner, best served with free-range jelly beans</h2>
    <p>
      The preferred meal of Charlie Kelly, from "It's Always Sunny in
      Philidelphia".
    </p>
    <p>
      Only the <em>finest</em> cuts of beef should be used, and is delicious
      when served immediately, or after fermenting in the trash for a week.
