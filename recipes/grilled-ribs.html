    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <div class="left">
      <h4>For the Ribs</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>4 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons white sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>2 racks baby back pork ribs</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="right">
      <h4>For the Glaze</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>⅓ cup ketchup</li>
        <li>¼ cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons rice vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Mix salt, sugar, black pepper, paprika, and garlic powder for dry rub
        together in a small bowl. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Line a large sheet pan with heavy-duty aluminum foil. Place rack of ribs
        on the prepared pan, bone side down. Poke all over with a sharp knife.
        Make shallow slits across at an angle, and then repeat the opposite way;
        this allows the dry rub to penetrate. Coat on both sides with rub; flip
        back over, ensuring the bone side is down. Wrap tightly with foil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer to the center of the preheated oven and bake for 2 hours.
        Remove from the oven and let cool to room temperature. Refrigerate until
        cold and firm, at least 2 hours, up to overnight.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat a charcoal grill until coals are very ashy and hot.</li>
      <li>
        Remove from the refrigerator, unwrap, and brush off excess fat. Slice
        between the bones to separate each rib.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine ketchup, brown sugar, soy sauce, vinegar, oil, and cayenne with
        a spoon in a bowl for glaze.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place ribs on the preheated grill and cook for 2 minutes; flip and brush
        over glaze. Flip and repeat process until ribs are as caramelized as you
        prefer, about 10 minutes more.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove to a plate and brush over one more application of glaze. Serve.
      </li>
    </ol>
